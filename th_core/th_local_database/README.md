# Floor
```
https://pub.dev/packages/floor
```

**The typesafe, reactive and lightweight SQLite abstraction for your Flutter applications (iOS, Android, Linux, macOS, Windows)**

This is an example on how to use the library.

---

The library's name derives from the following.
*Floor* as the *bottom layer* of a [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) which points to the analogy of the database layer being the bottom and foundation layer of most applications.
Where *fl* also gives a pointer that the library is used in the Flutter context.
