# TH CORE

Flutter core package to explore the `BLOC architecture`, network, localization, ....

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

- Use `flutter_bloc` packages to implement BLoC architecture.
- Easy translations for many languages with `easy_localization` package.
- Use overlay to show loading/error.
- Networking with `dio` package.
-  Dividing a project into different modules (`modularization`)

#### What is Modularization
***Modular programming*** is a software design technique to separate functionality into independent, interchangeable module, so that each contains everything necessary to execute a specific functionality.

#### Why we should care about Modular approach?

For example, on the left, we can only split the work for two developers or more. But on the right side, we can split the work for five developers or more, and also this is very suitable for a large team because we split the project as a module. So the developer can focus on their module.
